Things to prove for myself later:
Derivation of linear fit
derivation of lienar fit from linear algebra
derivation of linear fit for quadratic

derivation of exponential fit (did this on paper already)

#To do: 

# Done:
# 8. Rational fits P(x)/Q(x) (hard) - x
# 7. Recurrence fits (?) (Hard) 
# 2. logarithmic (easy)

# Day 1:
# 1. polynomial of degree n (easy)
# 3. Power law ax^b (easy) 
# 5. Piecewise (medium) 
# 6. Factorial (medium) (maybe)
# 9. Polynomial interpolation (hard) 
# 4. rsin(\Omega x) + rcos(\Omega x) (hard) (maybe)
# 10. Discrete Fourier ? 
# 11. Compute Continued fraction (?)


# Day 3
# Set title and set formulas for each graph

# Day 3:
# Conduct meta analysis of all sequences? 
# Uploading csv of sequences

# Day 4:
# Probabilistic dependence
# Improve Search to not require seqID



# Fun note: the cache wasn't working and each function was caching 
#the sequence over and over again 
# - I asked chatGPT what the problem was and it recommended I
# Implement a "lock file" (???) to "ensure single creation" - 
# the actual problem was I was doing 
#if(!file.exists(paste0("./cache", seqID))) instead of 
# if(!file.exists(paste0("./cache/", seqID)))
